# LA1CH3 Design System

Design system resources used to build LA1CH3-branded applications.

## System Ethos

The LA1CH3 design system style is based off the following ideas:

- Retro but clean - old web design meets new
- Minimalist
- Heavy use of black/white, accentuated with bright colors for stark contrast
- Slight "techiness" - monospace fonts, sharp edges, pixellation
